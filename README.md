# Jaram Gaming Bot

**Jaram is a computer science circle in Hanyang University. [Circle Link](https://jaram.net)**

We do various activities with each other such as Membership Training, workshops, and also games!

Speaking of games, our circle has an private discord server in order to perform voice chats while playing games in teams. 

In order to be efficient in managing the discord server, I decided to put in a bot that is going to be convenient. I put in some commands that we usually need while we are online and about to play games.

### Commands
